        So, I made to small batches from this recipe. I divided the recipe in half. The first I made copied the exact recipe. The second one slight mashed the canned yams and added some salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon. I baked it at 400F for 10 min bc the top of the marshmallow was already almost burnt.This mashed potatoes recipe will give you the proper technique to make perfect mashed potatoes every time — buttery, fluffy, and lump-free for the ultimate comfort food!
