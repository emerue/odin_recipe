        So, I made to small batches from this recipe. I divided the recipe in half. The first I made copied the exact recipe. The second one slight mashed the canned yams and added some salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon. I baked it at 400F for 10 min bc the top of the marshmallow was already almost burnt.Verdict: I preferred the second version. The exact recipe was a bit bland. The marshmallow on both were rock hard, did not have that gooey affect. So maybe next time I'll bake at 350F for 15 min? I'm not sure. I'm glad I tested this recipe BEFORE Thanksgiving. The yams were drained but still had a lot of liquid.
